            <h1>Welcome!</h1>
            <p> Hello! I'm a 3rd year student studying Business Administration and Computer Science at Wilfrid Laurier University. Ever since coding my first game in JavaScript back in high school, I have continuously been seeking out new and better ways to not only solve problems but also clearly present their solutions—whether it be in code or in just plain English. In other words, I am extremely happy to be in the program that I'm in!</p>
            
            <p>Technology is something I have always taken for granted; it's remarkably convenient but also daunting to fully grasp. In terms of just Computer Science, there are already so many fields to learn about: programming languages, algorithms and data structures, networking and communication, databases, graphics, artificial intelligence, and plenty more. Although I have coded programs before, they were manly to solve small problems or to automate simple processes. While I know it's necessary to start somewehere, I also know that I've only scratched the surface. Computers really are both the backbone and face of modern-day modes of communication, appliances, and complex organizations, and to be able to proficiently navigate through their applications is truly an asset.</p>
            
            <p>By the same token, studying Business allows me to analyze, understand, and improve on the very organizations and systems that makes this world operate the way that it does. When I learn about accounting, finance, entreprenurship, and management, I get an inside look on the specifics of how people, over the years, have developed methods to optimize the way they run their livelihoods. By doing so, I can learn to better manage and distribute money, promote an idea, communicate and work with others, and just make better-informed decisions in general. It's not just a degree, that I'm aiming for—I want to learn how the world works and be able to confidently contribute to it.</p>

            <p>Overall, both Business Administration and Computer Science have struck me as such integral building blocks of our everyday life that I think it would be a shame not to give them a shot.</p>

            <p> I'm currently trying to learn new things and develop more practical skills—making this website is one of those attempts! I'm experimenting with the layout and testing out as many HTML and CSS options that I can. Please let me know what you think of it so far &rarr; <a href="contact.html"><img class="small-logo" src="images/emailLogo.png" alt="Email logo"></a>
